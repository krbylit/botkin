<p>The University of Nebraska-Lincoln Archives and Special Collections houses the Benjamin A. Botkin Collection of Applied American Folklore, from which all of the letters contained in this project have been gathered. All of the correspondence represented in this project has been reproduced with the permission of the UNL Archives and Special Collections. The Botkin collection is comprised of two major components: his personal library containing over 8,000 books and 423 linear feet of paper documents. The paper documents include field notes from his work at the Federal Writers' Project, his personal research notes, manuscripts and drafts of his publications and speeches, and personal and business correspondence. The correspondence spans a period from 1909 to 1976, past Botkin's death. Correspondence included in the collection contains thousands of letters donated by the Botkin family, and includes letters authored by various members of the Botkin family addressed to people other than Benjamin. Benjamin's business correspondence includes letters to and from prominent individuals such as Woody Guthrie, Charles Seeger, Ruth Crawford Seeger, Pete Seeger, Norman Rockwell, Langston Hughes, Ira and George Gershwin, and Mari Sandoz.</p>
<!--<p>The majority of Botkin's letters from the time period this project focuses on are hand typed carbon copies of the letters he sent. Most of the letters were copied onto onion skin paper, making their physical quality particularly fragile. Some letters have already began to deteriorate, with Botkin's signature being barely legible or not present at all.</p>
<p>The Botkin Collection at UNL is currently the only resource available to access Benjamin Botkin's letters in full. The Library of Congress houses some letters from people who corresponded with Botkin, including the Gershwins, Woody Guthrie, and Alan Lomax, but does now possess any of Botkin's letters. Similarly, the National Archives contains no material pertaining directly to Botkin. Excerpts from select letters of Benjamin's have been quoted in various articles and books. However, searches for print publications of Botkin's correspondence in full yield similar unfruitful results. As such, it would seem that this project marks the first effort not only to digitize but also publish any of Benjamin's letters in full. The cultural significance of Botkin's life and works is deserving of scholarly treatment and preservation. With the digital technologies now available these materials can be made widely available to interested persons and scholars for further research and treatment.</p>-->
